# `mdup`

[![Build](https://github.com/alexandru-dinu/mdup/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alexandru-dinu/mdup/actions/workflows/main.yml)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/mdup.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/mdup/)

`mdup` is a command-line tool for keeping markdown files up-to-date by injecting code, script or command output between special blocks. One immediate use case is keeping documentation up-to-date without having to manually update markdown files with info from code snippets, scripts or command outputs [^1].

`mdup` does not depend on anything apart from Python stdlib.

## Install

```
pip install mdup
```

## Usage
<!-- MDUP:BEG (CMD:poetry run mdup --help) -->
```
usage: mdup [-h] -i INPUT [-o OUTPUT] [-v]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        input markdown file
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        output markdown file; if not specified, the input file
                        will be edited in place
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
```
<!-- MDUP:END -->

`mdup` will replace the contents between each **block** given the appropriate action kind (see details below).
You can keep files up-to-date by simply rerunning `mdup`.

Omitting the `-o` option will edit the file in-place.

For example, the command-line usage block above is automatically generated by defining the following block in the README.md:

    <!-- MDUP:BEG (CMD:poetry run mdup --help) -->
    <!-- MDUP:END -->

then running `mdup -i README.md` which executes `poetry run mdup --help` and injects the output inside the block.

## Block definition

The blocks are defined using HTML comments.

**Begin**

    <!-- MDUP:BEG ({KIND}:{CONTENTS}) -->

where `{KIND}` can be either:
- `SRC`: to include the contents of `{CONTENTS}`, e.g. from a path
- `RUN`: to execute the script from `{CONTENTS}` and inject its stdout in the block
- `CMD`: to execute the command from `{CONTENTS}` and inject its stdout in the block

For `SRC` and `RUN` commands, `{CONTENTS}` must be a path relative to the markdown file containing the blocks.

**End**

    <!-- MDUP:END -->

The blocks must be defined as the sole contents of the line, i.e. matching `^` and `$` anchors.

## Examples

For examples, see [tests](./tests/).

One _real-world_ use case is my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
[README.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexandru-dinu/advent-of-code/main/README.md),
in which I use `mdup` to automatically update year progress badges.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

I created this tool primarily to meet my own needs -- it's very simple and ad-hoc. While I don't anticipate it gaining too much adoption, always beware when running `mdup` on markdown files of unknown origin (which can be malicious), e.g.:

    <!-- MDUP:BEG (CMD:rm -rf /) -->
    <!-- MDUP:END -->

This tool should only be used for **simple** tasks, e.g. keeping **simple** documentation up-to-date.
